Invoice Generator App
Packages
- Model
- View
- Controller

Model Classes:
- InvoiceLines  (Item Name, Item Count, Item Price)

- InvoiceHeader (Invoice No., Customer Name, Date, Total)

Note: classes were created with variables as per instructions provided, still need to work on the coding with the GUI to make it fully functional. 
I’m working on the Invoice No. issue to make it auto generate.

View frames:
- Main Frame
Menu bar was added with Load and Save options “still need to work on the upload and save to the csv file, I found a reusable code but couldn’t add it, I need to study it 1st then 
implement it my way”.

User can click on New Invoice and the window to add the customer will be displayed.
Once user add customer then click on Ok, the add new item window will be displayed.


- New Invoice Frame (New customer)
User can add customer then click Ok to open items window and add item.

- New Item Window Frame:
User can add item name, price & count, and the total amount for the item will be displayed within same window. “need to configure the connection to Jtable then Controller”.


Notes: Please note that I didn’t have a previous experience in java and that I’m not a developer, but I’m a manual tester hoping to upgrade to automation, 
I’m committed to the scholarship and I hope to have the chance to continue working on this project and the automation project as well.
